# Paige's PSC Kit
a small discord bot kit using PSC and stews that automatically builds commands and compiles classes for you

if you want to add a custom directory into the bot like buttons or something then you can go to the [config.json](https://github.com/nuttmegg/paiges-psc-kit/blob/main/config.json) file and add one

- build folders are ones that are just ran through like commands and events
- compile folders are ones that are compiled into one object like assets and data
